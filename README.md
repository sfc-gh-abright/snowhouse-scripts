# Scripts to Analyse Automatic Clustering

SQL commands to analyze clustering performance. Made for the parallel file selection project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5zxWs98dGsUvcQy-nA7YZ8M4rKtXToFI-7FJ0rlLqk/edit?tab=t.0

- `analysis.sql`: Script for analyzing clustering tasks on Snowhouse. Eg cycle durations, time-to-cluster, average depth
- `load_test_manager_[disabled/enabled].sql`: Scripts to simulate streaming data into tables. For testing clustering performance.

Scripts may be messy and un-ordered; they are mainly here for reference.
